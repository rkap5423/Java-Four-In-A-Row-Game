This project is a custom Connect 4 game created from scratch, in collaboration with a friend. It contains a custom UI built with JavaFX, and can be run with Maven. For convenience, a .exe file is provided to test out the application in one step. The main file is JavaFXTemplate, and contains most of the UI code. The Player and GameButton classes contain core functionality objects for the game, and the GameLogic class contains most of the logic methods used to check for wins and ties and valid moves.
